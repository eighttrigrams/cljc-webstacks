# fullstack-cljc

Proof of concept for a fullstack `Clojure(Script)`, `reagent`-based
application

- JWT-authentication with `buddy-auth`
- The browser's back button works as expected with the help of `secretary` and `accountant`.
- `cljc`-code can be shared between API and UI. 
- Hot-code reloading via `figwheel-main` and `lein-ring`
- The test suites include tests against a running `Jetty` with full authentication/authorization.
- Data-driven design

Regarding the last point, the general idea for the API architecture is that except for `/api/login` everything else is done via 
`/api/` directly. Maps are used to communicate between front- and backend instead of url parameters or different endpoints. For example `{:query-type "resources" :query {:q "t"}}` will yield results for a prefix-search of resources. `clj/fullstack/dispatch.clj` will delegate calls to other modules, here the resources module, where the handler there gets the query and permissions passed as its context.

## Getting started

### Preparations

Install react

	$ npm i

### Starting the application

To start the backend, run

	1$ lein ring server-headless

This - via `ring-server` - provides hot-code-reload for the `clj` and `cljc` artifacts out of the box. Save a file (try `src/clj/resources.clj`) and make another request to see the changes.

To start and develop the UI, run

	2$ lein fig:build   # serves the single page application under `localhost:9500` 

This will provide hot-code reload for `cljs` and `cljc` artifacts via `figwheel-main`. It will automatically refresh the page after files have been changed. It will also give you the `rebel-readline`. Try it

```
user=> (js/alert "Hi")
```

## Packaging

Package the application and run it with the following commands.

```
$ lein clean
$ lein fig:min
$ lein ring uberjar # The packaged jar is self contained 
					# and contains API and UI, including npm-dependencies
$ java -jar target/fullstack-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

## Development

During development the application both `localhost:3000` and `localhost:9500` are used.
The latter is what we use to access the app in the browser, the former what can be used to access the
API directly (see section below).

Entering `lein fig:build` instructs Figwheel to start its own server to server the frontend. When the frontend
tries to access `/api` or `/login`, these calls get proxied to the actual backend running at port `3000`.

Note that during development the route `localhost:9500/login` will not work when entered into the browser.
However, that does work once the app is packaged. That is, one will be able to access `localhost:3000/login` via the web-browser.

### API Usage

The backend is reachable via `localhost:3000`.

Post `{ "name": "user-1", "pass": "pass-1" }` to `/login` to obtain a token.

Use token and post `{ "query-type": "resources", "query": { "q": "" }}` to `/api` to see available and matching resources.

Use token and post `{ "query-type": "permissions" }` to `/api` to see actual permissions.


### Testing

#### API

* Test-Suite against a real jetty, mainly for testing authentication/authorization
* Unit tests
* Test against `clj` and `cljc` artifacts

Run

	$ lein test

#### UI

* Unit tests via infrastructure provided by figwheel
* Test against `cljs` and `cljc` artifacts

Tests are available
at `http://localhost:9500/figwheel-extra-main/auto-testing`
or via

	$ lein fig:test
